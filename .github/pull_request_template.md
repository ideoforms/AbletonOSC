## Checklist

This project is run by a single unpaid maintainer, and long PRs containing a lot of AI-generated content are complex and time-consuming to review. With this in mind, please proof-read all content carefully before submitting, and ensure that surplus files (additional documentation, test procedures, etc) are not checked in before submitting the PR.
